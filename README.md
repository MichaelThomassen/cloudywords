## ☁️ How to Play

- You start with two clouds hiding the word.
- Guess letters using the on-screen keyboard.
- Correct letters appear in their positions between the clouds.
- Reveal the first or last letter to remove that cloud and show the word’s full length.
- Your score starts at **10☁️** per word and decreases by **1☁️** per wrong guess (minimum **2☁️**).
- Earn points to unlock upgrades that reveal hints, reduce distractions, or give bonus letters.
- Unlock the **Daily Boost** upgrade to supercharge 5 words per day with **10× points**.
- The game gets easier the more you play, but you can refund upgrades to adjust difficulty.
- All words are 5+ letters long and contain only basic English characters (A–Z).
- A word may have multiple meanings, but usually only one or two definitions are shown.

Each word comes with a short, dictionary-style definition to help you build your English vocabulary as you play.  
There are currently **1,500 words** in the game — and more are added regularly!
