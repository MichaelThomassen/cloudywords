<h2>About Cloudy Words</h2>
<p>Made with ☁️ and ☕ by Michael Thomassen.</p>
<p>The game is designed for mobile devices in portrait mode, but it also works pretty well on desktop browsers too.</p>
<p>Some words may have multiple meanings, but only one or sometimes two definitions are shown to keep things simple.</p>
<p>All words in the game were originally generated by ChatGPT but have been reviewed and corrected by a human.</p>
