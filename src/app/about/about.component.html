<h1>About Cloudy Words</h1>
<p>
  Cloudy Words is designed and developed by Michael Thomassen as a fun introduction to Angular—his first time using the
  framework.
</p>
<p>
  All words in the game were generated by ChatGPT and have not been proofread in any way, shape, or form (yet) — so
  expect a few surprises!
</p>
<p>The game is intended for mobile devices in portrait mode but works reasonably well on desktop browsers too.</p>
<p>The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/MichaelThomassen" target="_blank">GitHub</a></p>
<p>
  We use Google Analytics to count page visits and see where our users come from (anonymized). No personal data is
  stored.

<p>Have fun!</p>
